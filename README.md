## 🚀 How to Run This Project

 1. 🔄 Update Directory Path in Main Python File: <br>
- Before running the project, make sure to change the hardcoded directory paths in the main Python file (like app.py) to match the current location of your project on your system.

 2. ▶️ Start the Development Server: <br>
- Once the directory path is correctly updated, run the following command: 
"npm run dev"<br>
 - This will start the frontend development server.
 - A local web server link will be generated in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
 - 👉 Click on that link to open the web application in your browser.


##  🎨 Now Upload and Colourize
- Upload any black and white image using the interface.
- The image will be processed and converted into a colorized version.
- The resulting image will be displayed and available for download.
